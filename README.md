# Bulls and Cows
- a fun logic guessing game. 
### Game rules:
The computer will generate a 4-digit secret number(every digit is different and has value from 0-9).

In every turn you guess the number and you get number of **bulls** and **cows**.
* **bulls** - number of digits in the right positions
* **cows** - number of correct digits but in a different position

For example:

secret number: 2458

your guess: 2574

1 bull, 2 cows
